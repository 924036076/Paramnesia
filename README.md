# Paramnesia
An open-world survival RPG written in GDScript using the Godot Engine.

This game is a work in progress since May 2020 and is being built vertically. The goal with this project is to first implement every single mechanic, and then go back and build "horizontally", filling out levels completely and putting things together.
