# Paramnesia
An open-world survival RPG written in GDScript using the Godot Engine.

This game is a work in progress since May 2020 and is being built vertically. The goal with this project is to first implement every single mechanic, and then go back and build "horizontally", filling out levels completely and putting things together.

## Mechanics
Paramnesia is a unique RPG that gives you complete freedom to explore and build in a survival setting. In different areas of the map, you can encounter different creatures to fight or tame. You can build anywhere and the way your character moves in the game world affects how the game progresses and NPC characters treat you.
