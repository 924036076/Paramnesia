# Paramnesia
An open-world survival RPG written in GDScript using the Godot Engine.

This game is a work in progress since May 2020 and is being built vertically. The goal with this project is to first implement every desired mechanic, and then go back and build "horizontally", filling out levels completely and putting things together.

## Update, May 2021
It has been about a year since I first started this project, and a lot of progress has been made. Obviously there is still a ton of work to be done, seeing as though the game is not currently in a playable state. Paramnesia is the first game I've made in Godot, and over the past year I have learned a lot about GDScript, shader language, pixel art, and game development as a whole. The pace of progress has and will continue to increase as I become better at making video games. The multiple gameplay/story/genre pivots Paramnesia has seen have not been kind to the project schedule, either. With that in mind I would like to update this readme for the first time with the "new" plot of the game.

Originally, Paramnesia was going to be an open-world RPG that was primarily story driven. I wanted the character to move across a (very) large map with many sections but also have survival mechanics involved. I quickly realized that such an RPG would take a lot of time to complete. It would require a lot of custom art and meticulously designed levels. I also found that it was hard to incorporate building, taming, and other survival mechanics when the plot of the game required the character to constantly be on the move. So, for the past few months, I have been working on Paramnesia with new gameplay in mind. The new game will have story quests which allow for traveling, but the primary gameplay will happen in an open-ended manner in one location, a city surrounded by various wilderness biomes. This allows for me to more smoothly incorporate the survival mechanics I wanted to, which makes Paramnesia much more unique than the run of the mill 2D top down RPG anyways. This new gameplay means I have to do less art/commissions and less level design.

## Timeline
Updated 5/13/2021
I don't have an expected release date or even progress goals at this point. With that said, here is a realistic plan for the next year.
* September 2021 - NPC characters, enemies, and mobs are complete. The AI is functioning and they can pathfind and interact with each other and their environment. Everything that the player can do that isn't quest based (i.e. building, taming, resource gathering, etc.) is in its final state.
* January 2022 - Level design is complete for all main worlds and quest areas. Work on some quests has begun.
* May 2022 - The majority of quests are completed and polished, boss fights are designed and first implemented.
* September 2022 - Final art/music is created, all mechanics are polished. Potential commercial release.

## Mechanics
Paramnesia is set in a complex medieval city environment. As you play you will build your economic empire and be inadvertently dragged in military conflict against real and fantastic threats. You can build and organize your businesses and resource production and fight and tame wild creatures. The way your character interacts with the NPCs will change the city and the way they treat you.
